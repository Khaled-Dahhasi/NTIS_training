# Week 8 Development Diary: Data Structures, User Interface, and Tools Enhancement

## Overview

The eighth week was oriented towards refining the data structures, enhancing the user interface, and fortifying the toolset used for the word counter application. The main tasks addressed this week were:

1. Transitioning to a Linked List Data Structure
2. Improving User Interfacing for File Selection and Output
3. Implementing CMake for Workflow Management
4. Exploring Bitwise Comparison for Optimization
5. Introducing Memory Modifiers for Efficient Memory Usage
6. Engaging with the GDB Course for Debugging Mastery

Here's a day-to-day breakdown of Week 8's endeavors.

### Sunday - Transitioning to Linked List (`Part I`) and GDB Course Introduction

Sunday was about the initial transition to a linked list structure, a more dynamic approach that allows allocation for each new element, eliminating the constraints of a fixed size allocation. 

I also began my journey with GDB by going through the first video of the GDB course. This provided an introductory understanding of the tool's capabilities.

### Monday - Continuing with Linked List (`Part II`) and Advancing in GDB Course

On the second day, I continued my efforts on transforming the data structure into a linked list, refining the elements initiated on Sunday. 

To complement my software debugging skills, I engaged with the second video in the GDB course, diving deeper into the advanced functionalities GDB offers.

### Tuesday - Bitwise Comparison, Keywords, Memory Modifiers, and Further GDB Learning

Tuesday was dedicated to implementing a bitwise comparison. This ensures that there isn't a time constant leak, thus optimizing performance.

I also started to delve into the implementation of specific keywords, such as `exit()` and `abort()`. Additionally, I explored potential memory modifiers, aiming to utilize memory more efficiently by employing data types that consume less memory than the current ones.

My GDB learning journey continued with the fifth video from the course, adding more debugging techniques to my toolkit.

### Wednesday - User Interface Enhancement (`Part II`), CMake Advancement, and GDB Course Progression

The middle of the week witnessed the second phase of user interface refinement. The focus was on creating an interface that, after sorting a chosen file and generating output files, prompts the user to decide if they wish to process another file.

In line with enhancing the project's build process, the day also saw the second part of implementing CMake to manage file creation for users.

To consolidate my understanding of GDB, I proceeded with the fourth video of the course, exploring intricate debugging scenarios and techniques.

### Thursday - Finalizing User Interface, CMake Implementation, and GDB Course Wrap-Up

On Thursday, I integrated all the enhancements:

- The user interface was perfected to handle file selection, output generation, and repeated processing prompts effectively.
- CMake's implementation was completed, ensuring smoother workflow management for the application.
- To wrap up the week's learning, I went through the third video of the GDB course, mastering the art of debugging with this essential tool.
