# OP-TEE AES Example Report

## How to Run the Example
Execute the AES encryption and decryption example on an OP-TEE enabled Raspberry Pi with the command:

```bash
optee_example_aes
```

## Example's Purpose
The `optee_example_aes` demonstrates the use of the AES algorithm for encryption and decryption within a Trusted Application in the secure environment provided by OP-TEE.

## Execution Flow
The `optee_example_aes` Trusted Application (TA) demonstrates secure encryption and decryption using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) within the trusted environment of OP-TEE. The following details the flow based on the output logs when the example is run:

1. **Session Initialization**: The process begins with the normal world client requesting the initialization of a pseudo-TEE session.

2. **TA Loading**: The OP-TEE Operating System loads the AES TA into the secure world, which includes looking up the TA's unique identifier and loading the corresponding ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file.

3. **Session Handling**: Once the TA is loaded, a session is opened, allocating the necessary resources for it to perform its operations.

4. **Resource Allocation**: The TA prepares to encrypt or decrypt by allocating resources, including setting up the ciphering resources.

5. **Key Material Loading**: The AES key material is loaded into the TA. This key will be used for the subsequent encryption and decryption operations.

6. **Initialization Vector Reset**: The TA resets the initialization vector (IV), which is necessary for the AES algorithm to start the cipher operation.

7. **Cipher Operation**: The actual encryption and decryption operations are performed. Although not detailed in the output, this step involves the TA ciphering the provided buffer.

8. **Operation Completion**: After the operation, the TA closes the session, indicating that the encryption or decryption task has been completed.

9. **Session Release and TA Destruction**: The secure world releases the allocated resources and destroys the TA's context, cleaning up after the operation.

The output indicates that the encrypted data was successfully decrypted back to its original clear text, demonstrating the AES operation's success in a secure and isolated environment.

## Conclusion
The `optee_example_aes` serves as a practical demonstration of how Trusted Applications (TAs) in OP-TEE can be leveraged for secure cryptographic operations. In this example, the AES TA securely handles the encryption and decryption process within the confines of OP-TEE's secure world, ensuring that cryptographic operations and key materials are isolated from the normal world.

Trusted Applications in OP-TEE are essential for executing sensitive tasks like cryptographic operations, data protection, and secure communication. They operate in a secure environment, separated from the normal operating system, to provide a heightened level of security. This separation ensures that even if the normal world is compromised, the secure world remains unaffected, safeguarding critical operations and data.

In summary, this example encapsulates the core concept of TEEs â€“ executing sensitive tasks in an isolated and secure environment, thereby enhancing the overall security of systems that handle confidential and critical data.
